# Snake_Game_Project
This project is a classic Snake Game developed using Python's built-in Turtle graphics library for the GUI. The game simulates the traditional snake gameplay, where the player controls a growing snake to collect food and avoid collisions with walls or itself. The game interface is built with Turtleâ€™s drawing and event-handling capabilities, making it visually interactive and beginner-friendly.

Key features include:
1. Real-time keyboard controls for snake movement.
2. Score tracking system that updates as the snake eats food.
3. Game Over logic when the snake collides with itself or the border.
4. Modular structure with functions for game initialization, food generation, and collision detection.

This project demonstrates basic concepts of game development, event handling, collision detection, and GUI programming in Python.
